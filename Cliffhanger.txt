"Cliffhanger"
Cliffhanger is all about making the poor stickman die! >:) Keep hitting him with rocks to make him fall into the water! 
Don't let him climb up the cliff or you LOOOOSE!

Controls: Hold and click the circle and try let go when the meter bar is at the "orange" zone to deal the most damage. 
The red zone will overthrow the rock.The "light orange" zone will deal less damage. At the yellow zone, the rock will not hit the stickman.
